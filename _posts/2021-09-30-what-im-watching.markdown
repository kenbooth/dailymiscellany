***Squid Game* on Netflix:** I watched the first episode on the advice of my daughter. I'm looking forward to seeing what happens in the next episode. So far it lives up to the hype.

***McCartney 3,2,1* on Hulu:** Paul McCartney talks to music producer Rick Rubin and shares stories from his career. Each episode is fascinating and goes by too quickly. All I can say about this documentary is I wish there was more.

***White Lotus* on HBO Max:** I watched all of it and enjoyed it. The story is fine, the acting is good and it has all of the production values of a great show, but a lot of the dramatic buildup leads to not much. I'm glad it was a limited series because I'm not sure I would have stuck it out for much more.
