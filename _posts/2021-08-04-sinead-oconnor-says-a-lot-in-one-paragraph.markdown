There is a lot packed into this paragraph from Sinead O'Connor's, *[Rememberings](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55609892-rememberings?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=14ZLx7JNQP&rank=1)*.

> My intention had always been to destroy my mother’s photo of the pope. It represented lies and liars and abuse. The type of people who kept these things were devils like my mother. I never knew when or where or how I would destroy it, but destroy it I would when the right moment came. And with that in mind, I carefully brought it everywhere I lived from that day forward. Because nobody ever gave a shit about the children of Ireland.

It touches on her childhood, her anger at child abusers and contempt at being groomed a pop star. She goes on, "My own dream is only to keep the contract I made with God before I ever made one with the music business."
