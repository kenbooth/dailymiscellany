Day one Bonnaroo photo dump. Much better weather than last year, even though there was a slight weather delay for a thunderstorm. Thursday is always a more casual day seeing shows because weâ€™re a little beat from driving in, setting up camp and wandering the campground. Saw Briscoe, Angel Saint Queen, Abraham Alexander, JP Saxe and Suki Waterhouse. #bonnaroo (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CtjtS8NLYfL/">From Instagram post.</a>)
