This is a nice profile of Norm Macdonald from 2018. "At the Daily Grill, he ate a heroic amount of bread before telling me he would have done 'Weekend Update' forever. 'I told Lorne I would hire on like Walter Cronkite, and just take the money as it exists, and never ask for a raise, and just do it until I was 65,' he said. He paused a moment before adding, 'He didnâ€™t like that idea.' "
